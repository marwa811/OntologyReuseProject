A simplified list was deemed sufficient since the domain under study (cultural documents) will not have detailed medical information with regards to cause of death or health issues.  But instead of accepting a list of general usage terms for causes of death or health issues that appear in some sources (e.g. Wikipedia, Wikidatak, etc.), a standardized, medical classification was selected so that it could be of use for future analysis regarding questions involving the intersection of health and culture.\r\n\r\nICD-10-SMoL was chosen since it was the latest version of this list (June, 2018).

  "description" : "The goal of the Pathway Ontology is to cover all types of biological pathways, including altered and disease pathways, and to capture the relationships between them within the hierarchical structure of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The five nodes of the ontology are: classic metabolic, regulatory, signaling, drug and disease pathways. An extensive survey of the review literature along with searches of existing pathway databases have been used to choose terms and their position within the tree. The ontology is continually expanding along with the development of Pathway and Disease Portals at RGD. Mapping of pathways in other databases to terms in PW as synonyms further increased the content of the ontology. It also provided the means to bring in annotations made by these databases and link to their sites via automatic pipelines built at RGD. The ontology allows for the standardized annotation of rat as well as human and mouse genes to pathway terms. It also serves as a vehicle to connect between genes and ontology reports, between reports and interactive pathway diagrams, between pathways that directly connect to one another within a diagram or between pathways that in some fashion are globally related in pathway suites and suite networks. Metabolic, regulatory or signaling pathway terms have associated terms for the altered version of the pathway and the level at which the alteration(s) may occur. Proteins with mutations known to affect a particular pathway can be annotated to the normal and altered version(s) of the pathway and to a disease pathway, if known. Both the provision of terms for the altered versions of pathways and the representation of disease pathway diagrams as a collection of altered pathways are unique to the PW ontology and RGD's pathway data.\r\nThe Pathway ontology is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license version 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0), see\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0 for details.

It uses the pattern to represent N-ary relations and a recursive structure to make the representation of various measurements and units (e.g., \"5 kilograms\", \"4 miles per hour\", \"5 meters per second per second\"  straight forward and obvious. It utilizes the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to automatically order measurements of the same type (e.g., Speed) regardles of units. E.g., that 5 kilometers per hour is greater than 5 meters per hour. It does this by transforming all measures of a specific type (e.g., distance, mass, speed, acceleration) to canonical units. The canonical units can be modified by changing a few rules. I also include on the github page some SPARQL transformations that generate the rdfs:label for each measurement instance so the developer doesn't have to take the effort and potential error prone risk of doing this manually.  The version included here is the version after the SWRL rules have run and with the inferences exported and also after the SPARQL transforms have generated all the rdfs:label values. Although there are other vocabularies that address this problem they are either much more complex (addressing many additional issues besides units and measures) and/or do not automatically order measures of different units.

PDRO’s central focus is the structure of a drug prescription, which is represented as a mereology of informational entities. Our current use cases are (1) refining this structure (e.g., adding closure axioms, cardinality, datatype bindings, etc) for prospectively standardizing local electronic prescriptions and (2) annotating prescription data of differing EHRs for detecting inappropriate prescriptions using a central semantic framework. Future ontological work will include aligning PDRO more closely with the Document Acts Ontology.",

It includes an extensive set of unit definitions (e.g., grams of carbon per liter of seawater), and can facilitate automatic unit conversions (e.g., pounds to kilograms). OBOE can be easily extended to create Entities and Characteristics for specific research domains, making it both broadly applicable and highly customizable.\r\n\r\nOBOE is being used to improve data interpretation, facilitate reuse, and create precise and effective systems for data search and discovery.",

Additionally, the predefined intentions are also generic supporting the majority of intentions in the Web. In the context of CARRE, we utilize, as a first attempt, the web searches as provider and we only upload the relevant intentions (health and travel) to CARRE in the private RDF repository.\r\nA user (representing an individual person whose data is being represented using the terms of this ontology) has connections. A connection represents that a Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer of user provides intentions for particulars providers. A connection is therefore associated with a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that represents an installation of the aggregator. A provider can be the web searches, Facebook or Twitter. A measurement is associated with a provider and a connection in order to declare the connection (i.e. the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer) from which a measurement came.\r\nEvery measurement must have a date at which the detected intention was taken, a weight which defines the importance of an intention and of course the detected intention that is only relevant to CARRE.

The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes.\r\nThis ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery).

PeSONT classifies linguistic place terms using (Bennett and Agarwal, 2007) and uses prepositions of English language for location identification. Its implementation is to further the application of the PeNLP parser on human related problems by classifying place-like terms in natural language and for extracting geolocations.\r\n",

In order to bridge the gap between the overflow of HTS data and the bottleneck of integrated analysis tools, herein, we provide the first comprehensive GPCR ontology. The development and utility of GPCR ontology was based on previously developed BioAssay Ontology (BAO). The GPCR ontology contains information about biochemical, pharmacological, and functional properties of individual GPCRs as well as GPCR-selective ligands inclusive of their HTS screening results and other records. This provides the first all-inclusive GPCR ontology with all available data to model the relationship between the GPCR binding sites and their physiologic and pharmacologic role in physiology via small molecule chemical structures. We developed this system using emerging semantic technologies, by leveraging existing and descriptive domain level ontologies.",

In this study, we focus on the development and proposal of an ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays. This ontology includes entities from three distinct realms (biological, physical and data), which include both experimental products, their relations and the protocols describing their manipulation. The final outcome is a useful and comprehensive ontology in the plant domain, to be used as a log book by experimentalists, providing a formal relation between entities.",

Ada 7 Kabupaten yang menjadi stake holder danau toba setelah terlaksananya pemekaran sejak tahun 2000. Di tengah Danau Toba sendiri terdapat pulau yang cukup luas bernama Pulau Samosir. Pulau Samosir sendiri merupakan sebuah Kabupaten yang langsung berbatasan dengan Kabupaten Dairi di sebelah utara.\r\n\r\nMedia transportasi umum untuk menghubungkan pulau dengan daratan dipergunakan kapal motor untuk umum seperti halnya Angkutan Kota (Angkot) di daratan. Namun ini tidak terlalu banyak karena memang pelabuhan di darat juga tidak begitu banyak. Sisanya adalah kapal ferry. Kapal motor umum yang paling lancar adalah lintas Tomok - Tigaraja - Tomok. Anda tidak akan kesulitan untuk menaiki kapal motor umum dari parapat menuju Tomok dan Ambarita. Selalu ada setiap penumpang sudah penuh. Peserta <a href=\"https://wisatamurahmeriah.com\">paket wisata danau toba</a> yang ingin menyeberang ke Pulau Samosir untuk group kecil menggunakan kapal motor umum tersebut, sedangkan untuk group menggunakan kapal carter dari Parapat.\r\n\r\nSelain kapal motor, di Danau Toba terdapat beberapa terminal ferry yang mengangkut barang dan penumpang umum termasuk turis yang berwisata mengikuti <a href=\"https://wisatamurahmeriah.com\">paket tour danau toba</a>. Terminal ferry yang tersedia itu sampai saat ini adalah: Ajibata - Parapat, Muara - Nainggolan/Sepinggan, Tigaras - Simanindo dan Onan Runggu - Balige. Di semua jalur ini ada feryy PP sesuai jadwal yang ditetapkan.\r\n\r\nDemikianlah halnya program tour ke danau toba yang tidak pernah sempurna tanpa disertai dengan kunjungan ke pulau samosir yang merupkan bagian dan terpisahkan dari program tour danau toba. Oleh karena itu pemerintah Kabupaten Samosir menyebut daerahnya dengan semboyan \"Negeri Indah Kepingan Surga\".",

We enable deep drive visualizations driven off queries to knowledge graphs modeled on SCO, to help assist physician visualize the similarity of a patient to a study group, at a quick glance.

These axioms postulate that any object, any process and any relation can be identified, classified, described, numbered, localized and orientated, and the way it is obtained can be characterized. The axioms constitute the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY, also designated as IMGT-Kaleidoscope. As the same axioms can be used to generate concepts for multi-scale level approaches, the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY represents a paradigm for system biology ontologies, which need to identify, to classify, to describe, to number, to localize and to orientate objects, processes and relations at the molecule, cell, tissue, organ, organism or population levels.\r\nIMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®, has been built on IMGT-ONTOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe version 1.0.3 of IMGT-ONTOLOGY includes the concepts of IDENTIFICATION and an update of the concepts of CLASSIFICATION.",

  "description" : "Ontologies provide a common platform of controlled vocabulary for researchers who need to share information across a particular domain, inclusive of machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and relations among them. The need for ontologies that provide a systematic arrangement of available data and allow cross talk across various related domains is gaining momentum. In this backdrop, we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy, bio-molecules, chemicals and drugs, pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries. The ontology covers all cell lines from major sources like ATCC, DSMZ, ECACC, ICLC etc. and is built in OWL format.",

  "description" : "The purpose of this work is to develop an ontology-based framework for developing an information retrieval system to cater to specific queries of users. For creating such an ontology, information was obtained from a wide range of information sources involved with brain tumour study and research. The information thus obtained was compiled and analysed to provide a standard, reliable and relevant information base to aid our proposed system. Facet-based methodology has been used for ontology formalization for quite some time. Ontology formalization involves different steps such as identification of the terminology, analysis, synthesis, standardization and ordering. A vast majority of the ontologies being developed nowadays lack flexibility. This becomes a formidable constraint when it comes to interoperability. We found that a facet-based method provides a distinct guideline for the development of a robust and flexible model concerning the domain of brain tumours. Our attempt has been to bridge library and information science and computer science, which itself involved an experimental approach. It was discovered that a faceted approach is really enduring, as it helps in the achievement of properties like navigation, exploration and faceted browsing. Computer-based brain tumour ontology supports the work of researchers towards gathering information on brain tumour research and allows users across the world to intelligently access new scientific information quickly and efficiently.",

If the interaction scenario with a Web service is nontrivial (and incorporates session handling), annotation with WSIO concepts will enable automatic generation of client programs, scripts, or interactive applications with a graphical user interface. WSIO also enables automation of different ways of data transfer and data un-/compression or en-/decoding. We strongly discourage providers from developing complex interaction and data-transfer/compression scenarios, however when needed, WSIO may enable smooth automated interaction with them. Future versions will support more interaction scenarios. WSIO aims to serve also as a means to standardise the complex interaction scenarios primarily within both SOAP and REST Web services, and secondarily to apply also to batch execution infrastructure in general.",

Ontologies are an adequate framework to overcome this limitation, through their axiomatic definitions and logical reasoning prop-erties.

The thesaurus combines both genres and forms. Form is defined as a characteristic of works with a particular format and/or purpose. A \"short\" is a particular form, for example, as is \"animation.\" Genre refers to categories of works that are characterized by similar plots, themes, settings, situations, and characters.

It is proposed here to develop an ontology of the domain of HNS disorders using a standard vocabulary such as MeSH or SNOMED CT. The principal classes of an ontology include facet analysis for arranging concepts based on their common characteristics to build mutually exclusive classes. We combine faceted theory with description logic, which helps us to better query and retrieve data by implementing an ontological model. Protégé 5.2.0 was used as ontology editor. The use of ontologies for domain modelling will be of acute help to doctors for searching patient records. In this paper we show how the faceted approach helps us to build a flexible model and retrieve better information. We use the medical domain as a case study to show examples and implementation.",

  "description" : "Drug Target Ontology (DTO) is being developed at the University of Miami in the research group of Stephan Schürer. DTO is supported by grant U54CA189205 (Illuminating the Druggable Genome Knowledge Management Center, Tudor Oprea, PI) awarded by the NCI through the NIH Common Fund. It is a component of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project (https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg). The DTO project develops a novel semantic framework to formalize knowledge about drug targets with a focus on the current IDG protein families. The DTO is developed as a reference for drug targets with the longer-term goal to create a community standard that will facilitate the integration of diverse drug discovery information from numerous heterogeneous resources. The first version of the DTO consists of asserted class hierarchies of the four IDG protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels, and nuclear hormone receptors. Protein classes are linked to tissue and disease via different levels of confidence. DTO also contains drug target development level classifications developed in the IDG project (http://targetcentral.ws/), and functional and qualitative annotations and classifications for kinase proteins, GPCR ligands and ion channels. DTO is modeled in OWL2-DL to enable further classification by inference reasoning and SPARQL queries. DTO is implemented following a modularization approach. DTO is used as the organizational framework for drug targets in the IDG PHAROS User Interface Portal (https://pharos.nih.gov) and also the Tin-X Target Importance and Novelty Explorer (http://newdrugtargets.org).",

This framework will support cataloging different types of individual cells, understanding the functions of and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. During the initial two years of HuBMAP, the MC-IU team has built many elements of the CCF. We have led the design of ASCT+B Tables and implemented a CCF Ontology. We have collaborated with NIAID at NIH on the design of a 3D Object Library. Lastly, we have developed two interactive user interfaces. One supports CCF data registration. The other supports exploration of semantically and spatially explicit data—from the whole body to the single cell level. For an introduction to HuBMAP goals, data, and code visit the Visible Human MOOC (VHMOOC). \r\n\r\nThe CCF Ontology is CC-BY 4.0 Licensed.",

The new domain has been linked with existing ontologies, such as Units of Measurements Ontology, Food, Nutrient and the Bibliographic Ontology. So linked ontology consists of several superclasses, and for each of these the relevant subclasses, object properties and data properties are defined. To show how such an ontology can be used in practice, it was populated with 20 isotopic measurements of Slovenian food samples. Describing data in this way offers a powerful technique for organizing and sharing stable isotope data across Food Science. ",

We present an open ontology for the annotation of biomedical images (BIM) scripted in OWL/RDF. The BIM ontology provides semantic vocabularies to describe the manually curated image annotations as well as annotations generated by online bioinformatics services using content extracted from images by the Semantic Enrichment of Biomedical Images (SEBI) system. The BIM ontology is represented in three parts; (i) image vocabularies - which holds vocabularies for the annotation of an image and/or region of interests (ROI) inside an image, as well as vocabularies to represent the pre and post processing states of an image, (ii) text entities - covers annotations from the text that are associated with an image (e.g. image captions) and provides semantic representation for NLP algorithm outputs, (iii) a provenance model  - that contributes towards the maintenance of annotation versioning. To illustrate the BIM ontology’s utility, we provide three annotation cases generated by BIM in conjunction with the SEBI image annotation engine.",

The Society aims to promote the highest standards of care for patients with vascular anomalies by advancing clinical and scientific knowledge concerning causes, diagnosis and treatment, and by education of physicians, health care providers, patients and the community. The Society encourages the free flow of information between its members and interested groups, through workshop meetings and teaching programs, and by the dissemination of a classification scheme and pertinent scientific data.\r\n\r\nThe updated classification was approved at the May, 2018 General Assembly in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and can be found at https://www.issva.org/classification.\r\n\r\nWhat is the ISSVA Ontology?\r\n\r\nThe ISSVA ontology has been created to represent a sharable semantic data model of the ISSVA classification. This ontological representation of the ISSVA classification is machine-readable and facilitates interoperability between systems that capture data about vascular anomalies. It is structured hierarchically and contains all concepts of the ISSVA classification and the relationships between them. The ontology is available in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) format, and can be browsed and downloaded online: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ISSVA\r\n\r\nHow to Use the ISSVA Ontology?\r\n\r\nThe ISSVA ontology does not substitute the ISSVA classification, instead, it should be used as an additional component to facilitate interoperability. Every concept in the ISSVA ontology has a unique code that should be attached to the corresponding data element. In the context of databases, the ISSVA ontology codes could be added as an extra column to the existing data. \r\n\r\nMappings to Other Ontologies?\r\n\r\nThe ISSVA ontology contains machine-readable mappings to equivalent concepts in other ontologies, namely: the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO), SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), National Cancer Institute thesaurus (NCIT), and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). This means that data annotated with codes from the ISSVA ontology are interoperable with data annotated with the aforementioned ontologies, without any extra effort, as long as there exists a mapping between the concepts.\r\n\r\nIssue Reporting\r\n\r\nPlease contact ISSVA at info@issva.org in case you have any issues and/or feature requests for the ISSVA ontology. The ontology can then be updated accordingly.",

  "description" : "Named Entity Recognition Ontology (NERO) developed specifically for describing textual entities in biomedical texts, which accounts for diverse levels of ambiguity, bridging the scientific sublanguages of molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and medicine. The annotation of natural science texts is more challenging than in other domains. Biomedical language is replete with ambiguity distinct from that observed in news articles or informal text online. In biomedical texts, alternative meanings are not always clearly separated.\r\n\r\nFor example, in some biomedical contexts, the words for a named entity may refer to a gene or a protein with nearly equal probability; for example, “a mutant hemoglobin α_2” can refer to either a gene or a protein. If the author meant gene-or-protein A, and we force an annotator to choose either interpretation gene A or protein A, the resulting annotation is of limited utility because the choice between gene and protein is random if the meanings are equally likely based on context. NERO attempts to minimize unwarranted, arbitrary annotative semantic label assignments for textual entities. \r\n\r\nNERO defines ambiguous concepts, such as GeneOrProtein, which subsumes both Gene and Protein using the following axiom: EquivalentTo: ‘Gene’ or ‘Protein.’ There are no biological entities that are either a gene or a protein, but there are lexical entities that can correspond to either or both of these entities.\r\n",

This occurrence is an abstract concept, as it generally cannot be determined what are its boundaries in time, space, or population units. \r\n\r\nWe assume that several OBSERVATIONS are derived from each health event, and recorded in the same or different databases - for instance clinical journal, laboratory database, abattoir. At the same time or not. \r\n\r\nAHSO attempts to model these time specific observations. The ontology is focused on the modeling of the animal and health information connected to a single observation, made at a specific point on time. All the information recorded is relative to that specific point in time.\r\n\r\nFor instance, an animal belongs to a herd, which belongs to an owner, AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION. We do not attempt to model how that animal changed herds on time. Similarly, we do not model clinical progression.

We report our development of an Exposure Ontology, ExO, designed to address this information gap by facilitating centralization and integration of exposure data to inform understanding of environmental health.

BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based, highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL).  BAO currently has over 1000 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies.  It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen, Format, Meta Target, Design,  Detection Technology, and Endpoint.  Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen).  Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation).  Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based, organism-based, and variations thereof.  The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal.  Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal.  Endpoints are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50, percent inhibition, etc.).  BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays.  All main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification classes, which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive knowledge-based representation.",

All Entries can be subjected to an Operation (class from EDAM) producing an Intermediate (P:00010). An Intermediate has a TemporalEntity associated to represent its time of creation. Some Entries are specifically of the type Exit, meaning that they will represent concepts that exit the current category and be passed to the next one on the workflow. Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively.\r\nThe concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element.

The classes of PDO also capture the habitat, environmental conditions and expand the general characteristics of plants, completing the instances richness for plant species, geographical, classification and morphology. Furthermore, PDO builds the relationships among species, region, morphology, plant organs, developmental stage, revealing the list of species in an area, the morphology and life form of plants, and development process of species. In sum, PDO shows a growth process or development stage of a species and its structure characteristics in particular space and time scale, realizing the description of species diversity, ecosystem diversity and genetic diversity. At present, PDO has been applied to the platform of Go to Selected Open Access Journals (GoOA) developed by National Science Library of Chinese Academy of Sciences, supporting concept retrieval and concept extension for GoOA.",

Moreover, no synonym list or mapping currently exists between the varied category names. Furthermore, oncology history documentation is often inconsistent, incomplete, and not updated appropriately. The NCCN EHR Oncology Advisory Group has established best practices and is working with EHR vendors to implement and enhance tools for documentation of oncology history. This ontology is a result of the work of the group, and provides users with a list of oncology history categories and synonyms. It is our sincere hope that this work can form the basis of improving standardization and interoperability of oncology history documentation within EHR systems.",
