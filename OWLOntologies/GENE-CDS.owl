The value 'forward' means that the dbSNP entry uses the same orientation as the reference genome, the value 'reverse' means that the dbSNP entry uses the reverse orientation (i.e., the opposite strand of DNA). This information can be used for normalizing the orientation, and converting sequences from one strand to the other. All polymorphisms and sequences in the Genomic CDS ontology are reported using the forward orientation of the reference genome (the 'plus' strand)."
