Family Health Teams are groups of health care professionals, such as physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers and dieticians who work together to provide primary care for a group of patients. They provide a wide range of services including health promotion, treatment services, chronic disease management and prevention, rehabilitation and palliative care. They are available nights and weekends to provide health advice and care so their patients do not have to go to busy hospital emergency departments for non-emergency care. They also help their patients navigate their way through the other parts of the health care system to receive the best possible care (www.healthforceontario.ca). Family health teams are funded on a blended capitation basis similar to FHOs - the corporations may be governed by a community or provider board.

Scope:
Providing services at least within the regional geographic boundaries of the Wellington Waterloo Local Health Integration Network and receiving provincial health ministry public funding.

Borrowing from two new disciplines, genomics and proteomics, molecular diagnostics categorizes cancer using technology such as mass spectrometry and gene chips. Genomics is the study of all the genes in a cell or organism, while proteomics is the study of all the proteins. Molecular diagnostics determines how these genes and proteins are interacting in a cell. It focuses upon patterns-- gene and protein activity patterns--in different types of cancerous or precancerous cells. Molecular diagnostics uncovers these sets of changes and captures this information as expression patterns. Also called \"molecular signatures,\" these expression patterns are improving the clinicians' ability to diagnose cancer. Soon all cancers may be diagnosed this way.
