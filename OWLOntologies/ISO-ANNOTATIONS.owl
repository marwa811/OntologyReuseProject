   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#Thing">
      <annotations:definition>A [thing] is anything that is or may be thought about or perceived, including material and non-material objects, ideas, and actions.  Every [thing] is either a [possible_individual], or an [abstract_object].</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:note>NOTE 1	Every [thing] is identifiable within a system. System identifiers created by other systems and received as part of a data exchange may be stored for future reference as an identification, referring to the originating organisation or system.
NOTE 2	Every example provided for other entity data types declared in this schema is also an example of [thing].</annotations:note>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#PossibleIndividual">
      <annotations:definition>A [possible_individual] is a [thing] that exists in space and time. This includes:
- things where any of the space time dimensions are vanishingly small, 
- those that are either all space for any time, or all time and any space, 
- the entirety of all space time 
- things that actually exist, or have existed, 
- things that are fictional or conjectured and possibly exist in the past, present or future,
- temporal parts (states) of other individuals,
- things that have a specific position, but zero extent in one or more dimensions, such as points, lines, and surfaces. In this context existence is based upon being imaginable within some consistent logic, including actual, hypothetical, planned, expected, or required individuals.</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE	The pump with serial number ABC123, Battersea Power Station, Sir Joseph Whitworth, Shakespeare, and the starship "Enterprise" can be represented by instances of [possible_individual].</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#ArrangedIndividual">
      <annotations:definition>An [arranged_individual] is a [possible_individual] that has parts that play distinct roles with respect to the whole. The qualities of an [arranged_individual] are distinct from the qualities of its parts.</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE 1	The vessel with serial number V-1234 is an [arranged_individual].
EXAMPLE 2	The company Bloggs &amp; Co. is an [arranged_individual].
EXAMPLE 3	A laptop computer that consists of the main unit with its removable CD-ROM and floppy disk drives and power supply cables is an [arranged_individual].</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#Event">
      <annotations:definition>An [event] is a [possible_individual] with zero extent in time at any point in space-time - a four dimensional plane. An [event] may be at one-time only, or may extend in time at different places, or a combination of both. An [event] is the temporal boundary of one or more [possible_individual]s, although there may be no knowledge of these [possible_individual]s.</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE	The connection of power to a pump is an event that marks the beginning of a temporal part of that pump.</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#PointInTime">
      <annotations:definition>An [event] that is the whole space extension with zero extent in time.</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:note>NOTE 	In using this part of ISO15926, a [point_in_time] should be represented by a [representation_of_Gregorian_date_and_UTC_time].</annotations:note>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE	The time known as UTC 1999-05-13T16:31:23.56 is a [point_in_time].</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#PeriodInTime">
      <annotations:definition>A [period_in_time] is a [possible_individual] that is all space for part of time - a temporal part of the universe.</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE 1	July 2000 is an instance of [period_in_time].
EXAMPLE 2	The period described by UTC 2000-11-21T06:00 to UTC 2000-11-21T11:53 is an instance of [period_in_time] compliant with ISO8601.</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#PhysicalObject">
      <annotations:definition>A [physical_object] is a [possible_individual] that is a distribution of
matter, energy, or both. </annotations:definition>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE 1	A piece of metal is a [physical_object].
EXAMPLE 2	A tree is a [physical_object]
EXAMPLE 3	The thing identified by tag P101 is a [physical_object].
EXAMPLE 4	A light beam is a [physical_object].
EXAMPLE 5	A tank that is built and dismantled on site is both a [materialized_physical_object] and  a [functional_physical_object].</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#MaterializedPhysicalObject">
      <annotations:definition>A [materialized_physical_object] is a [physical_object] that has matter and/or energy continuity as its basis for identity. Matter or energy continuity requires some matter or energy to be common to adjacent temporal parts of the [materialized_physical_object]. Replacement of some components from time to time does not create a new identity.</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE	The shell and tube heat exchanger with manufacturer's serial number ES/1234 can be represented by an instance of [materialized_physical_object].</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#FunctionalPhysicalObject">
      <annotations:definition>A [functional_physical_object] is a [physical_object] that has functional, rather than material, continuity as its basis for identity. Adjacent temporal parts of a [functional_physical_object] need not have common matter or energy, provided the matter or energy of each temporal part fulfils the same function.</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE	The heat exchanger system known as tag E-4507, which is part of a distillate transfer system, can be represented by an instance of [functional_physical_object]. Note that this is distinct from the "shell and tube heat exchanger manufacture number ES/1234" that was installed as E-4507 when the plant was first built and later removed when worn out, to be replaced by a new heat exchanger with different serial number. "Shell and tube heat exchanger manufacture number ES/1234" and its differently numbered replacement can be represented by instances of [materialized_physical_object]. When ES/1234 is installed as E-4507 there is a temporal part of ES/1234 that is also a temporal part of E-4507.</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#Stream">
      <annotations:definition>A [stream] is a [physical_object] that is material or energy moving along a path, where the path is the basis of identity and may be constrained. The stream consists of the temporal parts of those things that are in the stream whilst they are in it.</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE	Flux is a 4D-constrained case of [stream] where the path crosses a surface.
EXAMPLE	The naphtha flowing in a pipe between a crude distillation unit and a platformer is a [stream].</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#SpatialLocation">
      <annotations:definition>A [spatial_location] is a [physical_object] that has continuity of relative position.</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE	Geographic datum, license block, construction area, country, air corridor, maritime traffic zone, hazard control zone, 4D points, lines, planes, solids.</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#Activity">
      <annotations:definition>An [activity] is a [possible_individual] that brings about change by causing the [event] that marks the [beginning], or the [event] that marks the [ending] of a [possible_individual]. An activity consists of the temporal parts of those members of [possible_individual] that participate in the activity. The participating temporal parts will be classified by the [participating_role_and_domain] that indicates the role of the temporal part in the [activity].</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE	Pumping a fluid with a mechanical pump can be represented by an instance of [activity].</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#ActualIndividual">
      <annotations:definition>An [actual_individual] is a [possible_individual] that is a part of the space-time continuum that we inhabit. It exists in the present, past, or future of our universe, as opposed to some imagined universe.</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:note>NOTE	The things we plan can usually only be assumed to be part of some imagined universe, until they come about.</annotations:note>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE 1	The Eiffel Tower is an [actual_individual].
EXAMPLE 2	The computer used to edit this part of ISO 15926 is an [actual_individual].
EXAMPLE 3	The fictional character, Sherlock Holmes, is a [possible_individual] who is not an [actual_individual].
EXAMPLE 4	The Earth in the year 2300 (assuming it still exists) is an [actual_individual].</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#WholeLifeIndividual">
      <annotations:definition>A [whole_life_individual] is a [possible_individual] that is a member of a [class_of_individual], and is not a temporal part of any other [possible_individual] that is also a member of the same [class_of_individual]. A [whole_life_individual] includes its past and future. </annotations:definition>
      <annotations:note>NOTE	A possible future temporal part of the [whole_life_individual] is a [possible_individual] that is related to the [whole_life_individual] by a [temporal_whole_part] relation.</annotations:note>
      <annotations:example>EXAMPLE 1	A plastic cup (bounded by its creation and destruction [event]s) can be represented by an instance of [whole_life_individual]. The cup whilst it stands on this table is a temporal part of this [whole_life_individual].
EXAMPLE 2	The universe for all time is a [whole_life_individual].</annotations:example>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#AbstractObject">
      <annotations:definition>An [abstract_object] is a [thing] that does not exist in space-time.</annotations:definition>
   </owl:Class>
   <owl:Class rdf:about="&part2;#Class">
      <annotations:definition>A [class] is a [thing] that is an understanding of the nature of things and that divides things into those which are members of the class and those which are not according to one or more criteria.
The identity of a [class] is ultimately defined by its members. No two classes have the same membership. However, a distinction must be made between a [class] having members, and those members being known, so within an information system the members recorded may change over time, even though the true membership does not change.</annotations:definition>
      <annotations:note>NOTE 1	The membership of a [class] is unchanging as a result of the spatio-temporal paradigm upon which this schema is based. In another paradigm it might be stated that a car is red at one time, and green at another time, indicating that the class of red things and class of green things changed members. However, using a spatio-temporal paradigm, a temporal part, state 1, of the car is red, and another temporal part of the car, state 2, is green. In this way the members of the classes red and green are unchanging. The same principle applies to future temporal parts as to past temporal parts, it is just more likely that the membership of these is not known.
A class may be a member of another class or itself.
NOTE 2  The set theory that applies to classes in this model is non-wellfounded set theory [3]. This permits statements like "class is a member of class", unlike traditional set theories such as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory found in standard texts [4].
There is a null [class] that has no members.
NOTE 3	The known members of a [class] are identified by [classification].
NOTE 4	Although there is only one [class] that has no members, there can be a [class] that has no members in the actual world, but which does have members in other possible worlds.

      <annotations:note>NOTE 1	The ONEOF constraint on some of the subtypes does not prevent a particular [possible_individual] from being, say, a member of a particular [arranged_individual] classified by [class_of_biological_matter] and a member of a particular [class_of_composite_material]. It is only the classes themselves that are not members of more than one of the entity types.
NOTE 2	Specifications or descriptions of useful objects are often intersections of several arrangement classes, allowing both shape and material aspects to be constrained. In this part of ISO 15926, such intersections are members of [class_of_arranged_individual], [class_of_feature], [class_of_inanimate_physical_object], [class_of_organization], [class_of_activity], [class_of_organism], or [class_of_information_object].</annotations:note>

These leap seconds are inserted on the advice of the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) (http://hpiers.obspm.fr) to ensure that, on average over the years, the Sun is overhead within 0.9 seconds of 12:00:00 UTC on the meridian of Greenwich. UTC is thus the modern successor of Greenwich Mean Time, GMT, which was used when the unit of time was the mean solar day. International Atomic Time (TAI) is calculated by the BIPM from the readings of more than 200 atomic clocks located in metrology institutes and observatories in more than 30 countries around the world. TAI is made available every month in the BIPM Circular T (ftp://62.161.69.5/pub/tai/publication). It is estimated that TAI does not lose or gain with respect to an imaginary perfect clock by more than about one tenth of a microsecond (0.0000001 second) per year.</annotations:note>
