AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :ARMS "The Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale (ARMS) is a reliable and validated scale for chronic patients (it has been compared against pharmaceutical registries, the MAQ questionnaire and clinical evaluation) [1]. It consists of 4 items that are interested in compliance when renewing prescriptions and 8 items regarding adherence to the medication regimen. The possible responses are 4 different options and scaled from 1 (\"no time\") to 4 (\"all times\"), assuming that a higher total score (ranging from 12 to 48) represents worse adherence to medication [2].

# Class: :ASRQ (:ASRQ)

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :ASRQ "Adherence Self-Report Questionnaire (ASRQ).

Your score is classified into six levels that indicate the degree of adherence from level 1 or \"perfect adherence\" to level 6 or \"nonadherence\". Zeller A. et al. used as a cut-off value up to level 2 (included) for those classified as sufficiently adherent (take their correct dose always but not always at the same time) and levels 3-6 as patients not sufficiently adherent [1].

This questionnaire usually accompanies MEMS adherence monitoring systems [1,2] and is validated: it has been used with patients suffering from hypertension, diabetes and dyslipemia [3]. However, it is not an optimal system due to its low sensitivity and low positive predictive values [2].

25 of the 30 items are grouped as follows [4]:

-Subjective items that must be positive to indicate correct adherence:
18. Feel more normal
26. Feel happier
6. More aware of what I am doing
15. Get along better with people
21. Thoughts are clearer
9. Feel more relaxed
29. In better control
2. Good things about medication outweigh the bad

-Subjective items that must be negative to indicate correct adherence:
3. Feel like a zombie
25. Things are more difficult to do
12. Feel tired and sluggish
16. Cannot concentrate
11. Unpleasant effects always present
28. Cannot relax on medication

-Items from the patient's health/disease model:
13. Take only when sick
20. Unnatural to take medication
1. Do not need medication once I feel better

-Items related to the optional:
24. Up to doctor when I stop medication
17. I know better than the doctor

-items about control:
5. Pressured to take medication
8. Take of my own free choice

-items related to prevention:
30. By staying on medication I can prevent a breakdown
23. Medication makes no difference to whether I become sick

pain-related items:
7. Taking medication will do me no harm
14. Medication will damage my body

The remaining five items constitute attitudes or beliefs that are generally considered important in determining compliance.

Using the clinical results achieved with medication as a way of measuring a patient's adherence to treatment is possible thanks to the direct relationship between compliance with the regimen agreed with the doctor and therapeutic effectiveness [1]. However, whether or not the regimen is adhered to is not the only factor influencing the degree of efficacy of a treatment, as each patient has his or her own individual response, making this indirect method a measure of inconclusive adherence.[2]

Always bearing in mind that some START criteria cannot be applied to patients with a PROFUND index greater than 11. These patients are also not recommended to start secondary prevention treatments. It is also not recommended to start primary prevention treatments for patients with multiple pathologies. 

Preventive treatments should also be desprescribed if the expected benefit exceeds the time horizon of life expectancy. 

With regard to bisphosphonates and anti-resortives, their suspension is recommended after more than three years of preventive treatment.

Opioids are high-risk drugs, so it is recommended:
- To evaluate in patients the existence of the following risk factors for respiratory depression: obstructive sleep apnea, morbid obesity with risk of sleep apnea, advanced age, use of other sedative medications, existing pulmonary or cardiac disease, etc.
- Avoid the concomitant prescription of minor and major opioids.
- In patients at risk of falls, the treatment should be reviewed for increased risk.

The extent to which a person's behaviour when taking medication, following a diet and/or implementing certain changes in daily habits corresponds to the recommendations agreed with the healthcare provider. Adherence involves adopting a specific attitude towards certain activities related to therapeutic treatment. In this case, it is considered that in order to be an adherent patient, it is necessary to achieve adequate behaviour when, for example: seeking medical attention; filling prescriptions and taking medication correctly; getting vaccinated; going to follow-up appointments; carrying out certain habits to maintain personal hygiene, control asthma, diabetes and tobacco; using contraceptives when required and not maintaining a risky sexual behaviour; and having a balanced diet in combination with adequate physical activity.  [1]

As early as 1997, the American Heart Association stated that patient adherence depended heavily on the patient's relationship with his or her environment: a minimum of knowledge, motivation, skill, and resources are necessary in order to follow doctor's recommendations.

- If poor adherence is concentrated in one or a small group of drugs, the determining component (economic barriers to acquisition or complex administration devices) will be intervened on.
- If non-adherence is related to adverse effects, consider a dose reduction, change to a therapeutic alternative with a different or lower adverse effect profile.
- If no adherence is generated, a combined strategy is recommended, to which a motivational strategy is always added.
- In case of high pharmacological therapeutic load, it is advisable to switch to pharmaceutical forms that allow a simpler dosage and the use of drug associations that reduce the number of doses.
- It is recommended that the patient be given written material describing the treatment regimen.
- In the case of advanced pluripathology and whenever possible, it is recommended that the patient/caregiver receive the medication in personalized dosing systems. .
- The patient or caregiver may also be suggested to use the App RecuerdaMed system.
- It is possible to suggest to the patient to register in some kind of calendar/table of hours or document the taking of medication.

It is validated [1,2,3,4], it is necessary that the patient has a medium sociocultural level and has a complex assessment procedure. On the other hand, it has the advantage of being highly sensitive [4,5].  It has been used in diabetic patients [4].

The test score ranges from 0 to 11, being less adherent to a higher score and being considered adherent only if all of its answers suppose 0 points, that is, it denies all of them. 

Three parts of the questionnaire are differentiated: the first deals with the patient's recent adherence before the test was performed; the second part surveys the efficacy and side effects of the drug; and the third aims to find out the patient's ability to memorize the treatment. The questionnaire is shown below: [6].

1. Please list all medications you took last week. For each medication listed, please answer the following questions (a-g): 
a. Name of Medication
b. How many days did you take it?
c. How many times a day did you take it?
d. How many pills did you take each time?
e. How many times did you stop taking a pill?
f. Why did you take it?
g. How do medications work for you? (1=good, 2=normal, 3=bad)

2. Does any of your medications bother you in any way? Yes
a. If you answer \"yes\", please indicate below the name of the medication and how much it bothers you.
Medication: \"X\".
How much does it bother you?  A lot Something A little Nothing
How does it bother you?

3. Below is a list of problems people may have sometimes with their medicines. Please indicate how it affects you (\"A lot\"-\"Some\"-\"Nothing\" and what medication) for each:
a. Opening or closing the medicine bottle/box
b. Read the letter printed on the boat/box
c. Remember to take all the tablets
d. Getting your medicines on time
e. Taking as many pills at the same time

Analysis of the results: 

Questions 1a-1e):
Did the patient fail to identify his medication in the initial question? 1= Yes 0= No
Did the patient stop or interrupt therapy due to late medication replacement or some other reason? 1= Yes 0= No
Did the patient report any omission of day or dose? 1= Yes 0= No
Did the patient decrease the prescribed amount per dose? 1= Yes 0= No
Did the patient take any supplemental doses or more medication than prescribed?  1= Yes 0= No
Did the patient answer \"I don't know\" to a question? 1= Yes 0= No
Did the patient refuse to answer any questions? 1= Yes 0= No
If the results >=1 indicate potential non-compliance.

Analysis of beliefs (questions 1g and 2-2a)
Did the patient answer \"wrong\" or \"don't know\" in response to question 1g? 1= Yes 0= No
Did the patient indicate the name of any medication that bothered him or her? 1= Yes 0= No
If the results>=1 indicate possible barriers to adherence due to beliefs.

Memory analysis (questions 1c and 3c)
Does the patient receive a multiple dose regimen (2 or more times a day)?  1= Yes 0= No
Did the patient answer \"a lot\" or \"something\" in question 3c? 1= Yes 0= No
If the results>=1 indicate possible barriers in the memory.

It is a type of indirect indicator [5], especially indicated for diabetic or depressive patients [7].

The CMA is a continuous, multiple-interval measurement that assesses the time the medication was available to the patient. It is calculated by dividing the accumulated days of available medication in a series of intervals (periods between prescription renewals) by the sum of days for each interval in question. It is possible to obtain, as with MPR, values greater than 1 or 100% adherence due to prescription collection overlap [1]. 

In some studies, the number of refills obtained (rather than the number of supply days obtained) is taken divided by the expected number of refills that should be available for the same time period [2,3,4,5].
 
Hess et al. suggest that CMA and MPR, together with Continuous Multiple Interval Measurement of Oversupply (CMOS) and Drug Refill Adherence (MRA), provide identical potency of adherence measurement [6].

The result is the total number of days the medication was stopped (treatment gap days) over a series of days or intervals, divided by the length of the time period of interest. The end of this interest period may be determined by a last recharge or by an arbitrary date (such as the end of the annual calendar). In the first case, we would be talking about treatment interruptions or gaps becoming  \"embedded\" within the total interest period, while in the second case, there may be the case of a \"terminal\" gap [1]. 
The degree of adherence is calculated without taking into account whether the prescription has been renewed before or after the estimated time [2].

It is calculated as the number of days without medication relative to the total number of days, all for a single interval.

It is a type of indirect indicator [2] and objective [3].

The most commonly used EMPs are the Monitors Events Medication Systems \"MEMS\", which allow certain parameters to be monitored using microchips [4,5]. The most common of these is the pill container that has a microchip in the cap that records the date and time of each opening and closing of the bottle.  This allows not only to quantify the compliance with the regime, but also the time pattern that follows. It is an expensive method but applicable to the community pharmacy [4] used by Martins AP et al. [6].

It is necessary to take into account certain aspects that are beyond the control of this type of device, such as whether or not the patient actually takes his medication [5] or whether the patient has transferred the pills to another container or does not carry it with him on certain occasions [7,8].

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :ESPA "Simplified scale for detecting adherence problems (ESPA) to antiretroviral treatment.

The ESPA is a validated[2] instrument for detecting adherence problems to antiretroviral treatment in HIV+ patients. It has been compared with Morisky type measures, with pharmacy dispensing records and with the percentage of doses taken properly for two weeks. Because of its convenience, it can be considered a suitable tool for detecting nonadherent patients in the clinical practice of community pharmacy. This scale, consisting of 6 questions with dichotomous answers, has been validated against pharmacy dispensing records and has high sensitivity, specificity and efficiency [1].

The main drawbacks are that it requires knowledge of medication replenishment and clinical progression [2]. The scale consists of the following items [3]:

1. The patient comes for his medication according to scheduled appointments or in a justified manner.
2. The patient knows how to take his or her medications.
3. The patient knows the name (brand name or active ingredient) of the medications he or she is taking.
4. The patient takes his or her medications in an appropriate manner with respect to habits, diet, etc.
5. Adequate clinical evolution and good subjective assessment.
6. The amount of medication that the patient keeps at home does not exceed the amount needed for 15 days of treatment.

Analysis of the results: 
Each positive response supposes 1 point and each negative response 0 points. If all questions are positive (grade 6), the patient is considered to have no problems related to adherence. The worst possible result (grade 1) is obtained when questions 1 and 2, or both, are negative, independently of the rest. That is, questions 1 and 2 must be positive simultaneously to consider a patient free of adherence-related problems. If either is negative, the degree of adherence is 1 regardless of the other scores. In addition, in order to convert the ESPA results into a dichotomous variable, patients are considered adherent when the grade is 5 or 6, and non-adherent when the grade is less than 5.

It is a type of indirect indicator [2].

The aim is to ask the patient the level of compliance with his pharmacological regimen [1-4] without being too intrusive, hence the test is initiated with step 1, as a conversational environment. The patient or the caregiver can be interviewed in person or by telephone (bearing in mind that in the latter case, objectivity problems are detected, as the patient tends to underestimate medication errors and simulate greater compliance with the regimen) [4]. It is a type of indirect indicator specially designed for chronic hypertension patients [5].

The questionnaire would be:  [5]
1. Most people, for one reason or another, have difficulty taking the tablets, do you have difficulty taking all of yours?
Analyses results question 1: if you answer \"yes\" you are considered noncompliant; if you answer \"no\" you are insisted with the following questions. 
Do you take them: \"every day\" - \"many days\" - \"some days\"? (You must choose an option)
3. Many people have difficulty following treatments, why don't you tell me how you're doing? (Pick up what the patient says).

Analysis of the results: you are considered non-compliant if you recognize that you have difficulty in any of the three questions (or \"fail\" in any question).

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :Healthcare_system "Several of the factors that interfere with the degree of adherence to pharmacological treatment can be grouped under the heading of \"factors related to the health service or system\".  Here we find aspects such as the importance of a good patient-provider relationship in order to promote patient adherence [1]. In fact, it has been studied that the simplest and most cost-effective measure that health service provider systems should carry out to improve adherence of sick patients is to make an effort to maintain a close relationship with the patient (for example, through telephone calls) in order to be more likely to keep the patient within the appropriate adherence margins.  This is especially true if the patient can be seen every time he or she needs it, by the same healthcare provider [2]. 

Equally influential is the capacity of the system to educate the patient by and for the care and attention of their own illness, as well as the capacity to provide them with supportive communities. 

Other factors that concern us in this group are those directly related to the functioning of the service. If the distribution of medicines is scarce, the reimbursement of the cost of medicines is inadequate, health centre workers do not have adequate experience in chronic patients or are unaware of their own characteristics, as well as if there is no adequate feedback on the performance of the system or if there is overcrowding (for example, it would lead to having to attend more consultations in less time), it would be possible to identify a negative influence of these factors in terms of the level of patient adherence referred to. [2]

Other important factors are the characteristics of communication between health professionals and patients [3].

It is divided into three parts or subscales with a total of 14 items addressing medication behavior, availability and adherence to appointments, and sodium intake. Each question is answered by choosing one of five possible options (Likert type questions): always (sum 4 points), most of the time (sum 3 points), sometimes (sum 2 points) and never (sum 1 point).  The total result of the test varies between 14 (minimum) and 56 (maximum) [1]. There are studies that demonstrate its validity [1,2] and especially in the black population [3].

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :Indicators "We found different ways to measure the level of adherence of a medicated patient. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages and some show greater objectivity than others. In addition, some methods have more limitations when it comes to being implemented: either because they require a larger budget, because they require a complex infrastructure, because a certain cognitive level or skills are required to perform the measurement correctly... [1]

Of all the possible existing methods for studying adherence in research, clinical practice and epidemiological studies, Lee C et al. conclude that the most commonly used are self-evaluation methods (questionnaires, scales...), \"electronic measures\", data extracted from insurance claims and prescription renewals, and pill counts.  However, as we have already commented, since each method has a number of advantages and disadvantages and not all are applicable under all circumstances, it is necessary to admit that there is no single correct way to measure adherence and no independent and completely conclusive indicator, but that it is necessary to triangulate often between several of them [2].

Here we analyze methods of different types: direct and indirect, with different degrees of objectivity, in which the physical presence of the patient is required before the health personnel or not, they can be written or verbal and they can be methods of continuous or discontinuous measurement in time. We consider that these methods are disjointed from each other since each type of indicator has a series of specific properties that make some methods more recommended in some circumstances than others.

There are numerous indirect methods (more than direct) and they obtain with greater or lesser success an approximation to the reality of the result according to the method chosen for each situation [2]. 
In addition, they allow us not only to deduce whether the patient is adherent or not, but also to see the \"why\" of his level of adherence, since they reflect behavioral forms and habits by allowing a range of responses from the patient beyond \"yes does this\" or \"does not do this\" [1].

The (indirect) method starts from the measurement of the inhaler device, on a first visit, on a precision scale. Subsequently, the inhaler is weighed again after a certain time of use in order to compare the difference in weight. With this differential, the patient's use of the device can be deduced. Knowing the therapeutic regiment indicated and the cost in weight of an application of the device, an assessment of adherence can be made. Some aspects to bear in mind are that it is necessary for the patient to know how to use the device correctly and that the measurement of the device is complex and requires trained personnel, adequate material and time [1]. 

It can also be considered as a pill counting method [2].

Another way to check compliance with inhaler therapy is to use SmartTrack which is an application that records the date and time the patient has taken the treatment and uploads the data to its website. It also sends reminder messages when you have forgotten to take [3].

# Class: :MAQ (:MAQ)

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :MAQ "Morisky Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ) - Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4)

It is a widely used and validated questionnaire in numerous studies that compare results with the use of MEMS, pill counting, drug dispensing records in pharmacies, and clinical evaluation. The questionnaire (developed by Green et al. [1]) has four dichotomous \"yes/no\" questions where the first two address unintentional nonadherence (e.g., when there is forgetfulness or lack of care) and the next two antiadherence to intentional nonadherence (e.g., when medication is discontinued due to improvement or worsening of symptoms). 

It is used to evaluate chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension or heart failure [2], among others, as it reflects the patient's behaviour with respect to compliance. It is brief and easy to apply, without demanding socio-cultural requirements and with great sensitivity (81%) although not so much specificity (44%) [6].  However, there are also studies that do not confirm the satisfactory use of this questionnaire as an adherence meter [3,4]. The questionnaire consists of the following questions:

Do you ever forget to take your medicine?
2. Are you careless at times about taking your medicine?
3. When you feel better, do you sometimes stop taking your medicine?
4. Sometimes if you feel worse when you take the medicine, do you stop taking it?

Analysis results: each negative response is scored with 0 and each positive response with 1, so that a total score of 0 indicates a high degree of adherence, 1 or 2 total points indicates average adherence and 3 or more, lack of adherence [1]. It is a type of indirect indicator [5].

We found in Spanish a version in which the answers that would demonstrate adherence would be \"no-yes-no-no\" [5].

# Class: :MARS (:MARS)

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :MARS "Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS).

It is based on the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) and the MAQ questionnaire [1]. These are 10 scoring questions to assess the patient's adherence, attitude to medication, and obtain an overview of the disease control the patient performed during the previous week. The questionnaire is as follows [3]:

\"Please respond to the following statements by circling the answer which best describes your behaviour or the attitude you have held toward your medication in the past week.

Do you ever forget to take your medication? Yes/No
2. Are you careless at times about taking your medicine? Yes/No
3. When you feel better, do you sometimes stop taking your medicine? Yes/No
4. Sometimes if you feel worse when you take the medicine, do you stop taking it? Yes/No
5. I take my medication only when I am sick. Yes/No
6. It is unnatural for my mind and body to be controlled by medication. Yes/No
7. My thoughts are clearer on medication. Yes/No
8. By staying on medication, I can prevent getting sick. Yes/No
9. I feel weird, like a 'zombie', on medication. Yes/No
10. Medication makes me feel tired and sluggish. Yes/No\"

Analysis of results: 
In questions 1,2,3,4,5,6,9 and 10, obtaining a \"no\" per answer indicates adding a point (a \"yes\" equals 0 points in these cases) and in questions 7 and 8, a \"yes\" adds a point (a \"no\" for these questions does not add a point). A total result after the test of 0-5 points indicates incorrect adhesion while a result of 6-10 indicates that the patient is sufficiently adherent.

There are other versions of this scale with different number of questions. We found a version of 30 questions to identify predictors of medication adherence in patients with chronic diseases and to contrast good self-referred adherence. In this case, if a score of 25 is obtained it is understood that the patient is compliant and if he is less than 25, suboptimal compliance is revealed [2]. There is also a version of 9 questions [5] validated by previous studies and another version of 5 questions [6] (also validated by correlation with dispensation in pharmacies [7]) in which each can score between 1 and 5 points, so that a total of 25 points (5 points per question) indicates a sufficient degree of adherence and below this score, we would have a behavior lacking adherence to medication. 

This scale is especially indicated for evaluating patients with chronic mental illnesses [1]. It has been validated by Thomson et al. [3] for psychosis and used by George et al. [4] in 2005 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Significant correlation is also recorded with biological measurements of the drug in the patient's body and with caregiver reports [7].

In 2008, the MMAS-8 scale is published, which consists of 8 items in total, where the first seven allow you to answer only \"yes\" or \"no\" and the last one is a Likert item of 5 options. It has greater specificity than its MMAS-4 version and allows us to know the reasons or situations behind adhesion problems [2]. It is a type of scale validated by comparison with pharmaceutical registers and by clinical evaluation [3] and with greater validity and degree of confidence for treating chronic patients than with the MAQ questionnaire [4]. The scale focused on hypertension is as follows [2]:

Do you sometimes forget to take your high blood pressure pills?	
2. Over the past two weeks, were there any days when you did not take your high blood pressure medicine?
3. Have you ever cut back or stopped taking your medication without telling your doctor because you felt worse when you took it?
4. When you travel or leave home, do you sometimes forget to bring along your medications?
5. Did you take your high blood pressure medicine yesterday?
6. When you feel like your blood pressure is under control, do you sometimes stop taking your medicine?
7. Taking medication everyday is a real inconvenience for some people. Do you ever feel hassled about sticking to your blood pressure treatment plan?
8. How often do you have difficulty remembering to take all your blood pressure medication?

Analysis of the results [5]:
Questions answered as \"no\" get zero points and affirmative answers get one point. A final score of 3-8 points is considered low adherence.

It is a type of continuous measurement [1] is the proportion of days of medication supply occurring during the prescription refill interval (where the last refill marks the end) or during a given time interval to assess adherence of patients on seasonal medication. It is a simple method where treatment interruptions are not considered when there is a lack of refill or renewal of the prescription, so the values resulting from this indicator tend to overestimate reality [2]. This characteristic differentiates this measure from other continuous methods that do have in perspective the treatment gap days, such as CMA, CMG ...) [1].

This is a questionnaire developed from interviews with hypertensive patients. A total of 44 relevant items were collected and included in the questionnaire. All items were scaled according to a Likert scale of seven points ranging from \"totally disagree\" (1) to \"totally agree\" (7). It is a validated questionnaire having been compared with other adherence meters (MEMS, BMQ and pharmacy records) [2] although its own authors suggested that it would need further analysis due to the difficulty of interpreting convergence results [1]. 

However, the fact that data on convergent validity are difficult to interpret points to the need to validate the MUAH questionnaire in other studies.

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :Medication_adherence "The process by which patients take their medication as prescribed. It consists of three distinct phases: iniciation, implementation and discontinuation [1].

The patient's non-adherence to the medication may be found in situations (or combination of them) such as: not starting or delaying the start of the prescribed treatment, implementation of the regimen below ideal or early discontinuation of treatment. A distinction is made between primary and secondary non-adherence:

- Primary non-adherence occurs when providers prescribe medication to the patient but the medication is never obtained, being in position to obtain it (since they have the prescription) as much as for the first time as in the case of of prescription renewal [1].

- Secondary non-adherence occurs when the medication is not being administered properly to the patient, being in possession of the drug in question. For example, it occurs when an incorrect dose is taken or at incorrect times, when one or some doses are forgotten, when the frequency of the dose is increased and when treatment is stopped too soon, either bu stopping it before the date recommended by the doctor or by not getting a new prescription [2].

There is another clasification of lack of adherence from the patient's point of view that may be intentional or unintentional:

- Intentional: the patient decides not to take the treatment for different reasons. For example adverse effects, poor perception of health benefits or confusion due to the completeness of the regimen, among others.

- Unintentional: the patient wants to take the treatment but in the end does not take it. For example, because of the complexities of daily life or because of fogetfulness [3].

In relation to reporting on medication adherence 
there is a guide called EMERGE created by ESPACOMP (European Society for Patient Adherence, Compliance and Persistence) [4].

The consequences of poor medication adherence are, among others:

- The treatment is ineffective.
- Increased patient morbidity and mortality.
- Increased healthcare costs [5].

Consideration should be given to the possibility of considering changes in the patient's therapeutic regimen or the death of the patient before the end of treatment, so as not to misinterpret such events as lack of adherence or interruption of treatment. This is why there is a need to avoid inaccurate or confusing information from information sources and services. In addition, it is also likely that a patient has left the country or has simply acquired his medication in a pharmacy different from the usual one in which he is being monitored. It is also possible that there may be verbal indications to stop treatment and this may be easily misinterpreted by another physician as a discontinuation of treatment [2].

Analyzing the presence of adverse side effects in the patient as a way to measure the adherence of a patient to a treatment is possible because the presence of these effects is an indicator that the patient takes his medication [1]. The method is neither completely conclusive nor objective [2], since adverse effects may appear as a result of the act of being medicated and not by the medication itself (noncebo effect) [2,3,4]. It is a method used in illnesses whose medication frequently leads to obvious adverse effects, so that the absence of them indicates non-compliance with medical therapy [5]. It is a type of indirect indicator [2].

ISO standards were created with the aim of providing guidance, coordination, simplification and unification of criteria to companies and organizations in order to reduce costs and increase effectiveness, as well as standardize the standards of products and services for international organizations.

ISO standards have been developed and adopted by many companies in many countries out of a need and willingness to homogenize the characteristics and parameters of quality and safety of products and services [1].

The ISO 11615 standards were developed in response to a worldwide demand for harmonized international specifications for medicines. It is part of a group of five ISO standards and four technical specifications that together provide the basis for the unique identification of medicines.

A drug is associated with a set of clinical details. These consist of information on the indication(s) of the medicinal product, its contraindication(s), its unintended effect(s) and its interactions. 

Indication(s) and contraindication(s) may both be restricted by information on population data referring to any particular indication or contraindication, and by information on data from another therapy, i.e. the use of one drug in relation to another drug.

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :Persistence "Persistence (term first introduced in 2001 [1]) refers to the period of time from the initiation phase of prescribed pharmacological treatment to the last dose taken. That is, it immediately precedes the third and final phase of medication adherence [1]. In chronic treatments and although there is no total abandonment of medication, persistence can also be measured since the calculation is made between the start of treatment or a temporary point of chronic treatment and the end of the observation period. Persistence analyses in this case should include a permitted time limit for medication withdrawal (which is calculated based on the pharmacokinetics of the medication) between prescriptions. If this time limit is exceeded, the patient is not persistent, whereas if the time limits allowed between different prescriptions are not exceeded, the patient is considered persistent [2].

Using information obtained from secondary databases, it is possible to obtain the Proportion of Covered Days (PDC) as the number of days with available medications divided by the number of days in the specified time interval [3] as a measure of persistence [4]. It is also possible to measure persistence by considering it a dichotomous variable and by means of a cut-off value corresponding to the maximum time period during which the patient may not take his dose without being considered non-persistent [2]. 

Measuring persistence in medication replacement (PR) is one of the two parameters (the other is adherence to daily medication) that some authors [5,6] consider necessary to assess the patient's therapeutic compliance (adherence to medication). PR is characterized by the number of consecutive monthly replacements over a longer period (usually one year) for chronic illnesses requiring prolonged medication [7].

Another important factor is the patient's acceptance of the disease.

This problem also affects the family and the people in the patient's immediate circle, since the patient is not well, so there are more conflicts between these people.

Therefore, adherence to treatment is also a healthy behavior since it helps us to fight and control the disease [1].

The questionnaire would be as follows [1]:

Do you ever forget to take your medication? (Yes/No)
2. Do you always take your drugs at the right time? (Yes/No)
3. Do you ever stop taking drugs if you feel sick? (Yes/No)
4. Did you forget to take your medication on the weekend? (Yes/No)
5. In the last week, how many times did you miss a dose? (A: none; B: 1-2; C: 3-5; D: 6-10; E: more than 10)
6. Since your last visit, how many full days have you not taken your medication? (Days: [...])

It is considered noncompliant if the patient answers in question 1 with a \"yes\"; in question 2 \"no\"; in question 3 \"yes\"; in question 4 \"yes\"; in question 5 \"C\", \"D\" or \"E\" and in question 6 \"more than 2 days\". The questionnaire is dichotomous, so any response contrary to adherence is considered non-compliance. Question 5 can be used as a semiquantitative, assigning a percentage of compliance according to the answer:
A 95-100% adhesion, B 85-94%, C 65-84%, D 30-64% and E <30% [2].

# Class: :Social-demographic (:Social-demographic)

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :Social-demographic "A wide variety of factors that interfere with the degree of adherence to pharmacological treatment can be grouped as \"sociodemographic factors\". With respect to these, there is a certain disparity of arguments about their importance or relevance in the degree of adherence of patients. [1]

The race of people has been considered in some cases as an influential factor differentiating whether the patient is an immigrant or not. In addition, it also has some implication in the degree of adherence, the cultural convictions behind each race [2] although they are often masked as social inequalities [3]. 

Another socio-demographic factor such as war (even when it has officially ended) influences from different angles: to the extent that the patient's economy has suffered, in the lack of medical control, in the existing anarchism... [1]

Age is a studied aspect for these cases but is not fully defined as to its influence on adherence is concerned. This is due to interferences with other characteristics of the patient (whether he lives alone or not, whether he depends on his parents or not, whether he resides in a developed country or not,[3] etc.). There are studies that suggest less adherence in adolescents than in younger children [4] and that the rate of adherence of young children depends on the parents or guardians in charge of the child. In this regard, the level of adherence may also be affected as the child grows and changes his or her environment, spends less time at home and in the family, and is more influenced by the rest of society [1].

It seems that applying concrete measures (distributing the responsibility of following the treatment faithfully among close relatives, setting objectives, giving rewards...) in cases in which the patients are young, results in an increase in adherence [5].

In adolescence, a lower level of adherence is recorded, probably as a response of rebellion against treatment control. In addition, young people who take on responsibilities prematurely tend to show even less adherence. In order to remedy this, it is necessary to try to minimize the conflicts between the adolescent patient and the parents, without decreasing the involvement of the parents in following the treatment guidelines. For example, efforts to educate parents about the attitude of their adolescent children to the disease they may be suffering in order to maintain a good relationship in the family would improve adherence [1].

With respect to the elderly, we find the problem that the patient usually suffers from a greater number of illnesses and, therefore, the therapeutic regimen becomes more complicated. In addition, the presence of congenital disabilities increases the risk of reduced adherence to treatment in these people.  According to Eney and Goldstein E. 6], the elderly are responsible for half of the prescriptions made in developed countries and more than half of the medical costs, being a minority group in society.

It is known that socioeconomic status cannot be considered as a consistent factor that can be treated independently to predict patient adherence. However, it is true that under certain circumstances, there are patients whose low socioeconomic status influences them in such a way that they may even be forced to choose between the demands of treatment or those of the rest of the family, due to the limited resources faced by some families. In situations like this and many others, socioeconomic factors are influential issues to consider when predicting or measuring adherence of sick patients.

It is necessary to bear in mind that there is a limitation due to the fact that the telephone survey is a method that underestimates medication errors and overestimates compliance [2]. Occasionally, the telephone call has been used to make other validated questionnaires and scales [3].

With respect to multipathological patients, tele-assistance and teleconsultation allows contact with health services 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This contact has to allow:
- Access to appointments with professionals (both the EIP and the specialties that are treating it)
- The possibility of inclusion in proactive monitoring programmes (health reminders, vaccinations, health alerts or monitoring in special circumstances)
- Inclusion in specific programs that help resolve telematically the most frequent queries and alerts that arise in self-monitoring.

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment :Therapeutics "Several of the factors that interfere with the degree of adherence to pharmacological treatment are grouped into so-called therapeutic factors. The complexity of the treatment, its duration or the frequency with which the drug regimen is changed by the healthcare provider responsible for it, are influential factors in the degree of adherence of the patient, although we are not restricted only to them. It is equally important to know if the patient has a history of treatments that have not been effective and/or if the patient does not immediately perceive the benefits of the medications. In addition, adverse side effects are relevant in assessing the reasons for lack of adherence, among others. It would be important for a medical service to be available to patients to help them deal with these effects [1].

It has also been shown that a drug administration frequency greater than twice daily encourages poor or insufficient patient adherence [2].

Other therapeutic factors related to lack of adherence to medication are polymedication, daily medications [3], and drug interactions [4].

The appearance of packages, doses, pill sizes, and all physical characteristics of the pills are also important characteristics for good adherence to treatment [5].
