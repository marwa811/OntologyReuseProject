        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>Derivation on the instance level (*derives_from*) holds between distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later. We say that one class C derives_from class C&apos; if instances of C are connected to instances of C&apos; via some chain of instance-level derivation relations. Example: osteocyte derives_from osteoblast. Formally: C derives_immediately_from C&apos; if and only if: given any c and any t, if c instantiates C at time t, then there is some c&apos; and some t&apos;, such that c&apos; instantiates C&apos; at t&apos; and t&apos; earlier-than t and c *derives_from* c&apos;. C derives_from C&apos; if and only if: there is an chain of immediate derivation relations connecting C to C&apos;.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>
        <rdfs:comment>Derivation as a relation between instances. The temporal relation of derivation is more complex. Transformation, on the instance level, is just the relation of identity: each adult is identical to some child existing at some earlier time. Derivation on the instance-level is a relation holding between non-identicals. More precisely, it holds between distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later. Thus we will have axioms to the effect that from c derives_from c1 we can infer that c and c1 are not identical and that there is some instant of time t such that c1 exists only prior to and c only subsequent to t. We will also be able to infer that the spatial region occupied by c as it begins to exist at t overlaps with the spatial region occupied by c1 as it ceases to exist in the same instant.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1. Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus</rdfs:comment>

        <dc:source>OBO_REL:part_of</dc:source>
        <rdfs:comment>Parthood as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation p part_of p1 is illustrated in assertions such as: this instance of rhodopsin mediated phototransduction part_of this instance of visual perception. This relation satisfies at least the following standard axioms of mereology: reflexivity (for all p, p part_of p); anti-symmetry (for all p, p1, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p then p and p1 are identical); and transitivity (for all p, p1, p2, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p2, then p part_of p2). Analogous axioms hold also for parthood as a relation between spatial regions. For parthood as a relation between continuants, these axioms need to be modified to take account of the incorporation of a temporal argument. Thus for example the axiom of transitivity for continuants will assert that if c part_of c1 at t and c1 part_of c2 at t, then also c part_of c2 at t. Parthood as a relation between classes: To define part_of as a relation between classes we again need to distinguish the two cases of continuants and processes, even though the explicit reference to instants of time now falls away. For continuants, we have C part_of C1 if and only if any instance of C at any time is an instance-level part of some instance of C1 at that time, as for example in: cell nucleus part_ of cell.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>For continuants: C part_of C&apos; if and only if: given any c that instantiates C at a time t, there is some c&apos; such that c&apos; instantiates C&apos; at time t, and c *part_of* c&apos; at t. For processes: P part_of P&apos; if and only if: given any p that instantiates P at a time t, there is some p&apos; such that p&apos; instantiates P&apos; at time t, and p *part_of* p&apos; at t. (Here *part_of* is the instance-level part-relation.)</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <dc:source>OBO_REL:preceded_by</dc:source>
        <rdfs:comment>An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C. The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.</rdfs:comment>

        <peo2:Definitions>A 6-kDa polypeptide growth factor initially discovered in mouse submaxillary glands. Human epidermal growth factor was originally isolated from urine based on its ability to inhibit gastric secretion and called urogastrone. Epidermal growth factor exerts a wide variety of biological effects including the promotion of proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal and EPITHELIAL CELLS. It is synthesized as a transmembrane protein which can be cleaved to release a soluble active form.</peo2:Definitions>

Apoptosis is the mechanism responsible for the physiological deletion of cells and appears to be intrinsically programmed. It is characterized by distinctive morphologic changes in the nucleus and cytoplasm, chromatin cleavage at regularly spaced sites, and the endonucleolytic cleavage of genomic DNA; (DNA FRAGMENTATION); at internucleosomal sites. This mode of cell death serves as a balance to mitosis in regulating the size of animal tissues and in mediating pathologic processes associated with tumor growth. Apoptosis that is triggered via CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS such as TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR RECEPTORS and DEATH DOMAIN RECEPTORS.</peo2:Definitions>

It is the result of increase in myocyte size, mitochondrial and myofibrillar mass, as well as changes in extracellular matrix. Enlargement of the HEART, usually indicated by a cardiothoracic ratio above 0.50. Heart enlargement may involve the right, the left, or both HEART VENTRICLES or HEART ATRIA. Cardiomegaly is a nonspecific symptom seen in patients with chronic systolic heart failure (HEART FAILURE) or several forms of CARDIOMYOPATHIES.</peo2:Definitions>

After binding to the ENDOMETRIUM, trophoblasts develop into two distinct layers, an inner layer of mononuclear cytotrophoblasts and an outer layer of continuous multinuclear cytoplasm, the syncytiotrophoblasts, which form the early fetal-maternal interface (PLACENTA). Trophoblasts with multinuclear cytoplasm and undefined cellular structures. Syncytiotrophoblasts secrete proteolytic enzymes that erode the ENDOMETRIUM for EMBRYO IMPLANTATION. They also produce steroid, peptide, and protein hormones (PLACENTAL HORMONES). Trophoblasts with single nucleus and defined cellular structures. As the PLACENTA develops, pockets of cytotrophoblasts serve as stem cells for syncytiotrophoblasts.</peo2:Definitions>

        <peo2:Definitions>A hormone that stimulates or controls the development and maintenance of female sex characteristics in mammals by binding to oestrogen receptors. The oestrogens are named for their importance in the oestrous cycle. The oestrogens that occur naturally in the body, notably estrone, estradiol, estriol, and estetrol are steroids. Other compounds with oestrogenic activity are produced by plants (phytoestrogens) and fungi (mycoestrogens); synthetic compounds with oestrogenic activity are known as xenoestrogens.</peo2:Definitions>
